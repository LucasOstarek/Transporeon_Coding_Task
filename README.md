# Coding Task

This is my solution of the Transporeon Coding Task

## Solution

I tried to use as few predefined functions as possible in my solution, 
but to solve everything with the simplest functions. In addition, 
I have always commented on how it can be solved easier or faster.

## Input file

The input file is located in the root folder. The input can happen either in the 
file directly or by creating a new file and inserting it. 
The file must be named `tasks.txt`. The original file must then either 
be renamed or deleted/moved.
